# 99-reactjs-project-ideas

A list of 99 projects anybody interested in learning and understanding moving parts of ReactJS should develop.

Are you always on hunt for project ideas to work with in ReactJS? Do you keep finding nothing more than Todo list and Calculator?

I understand your pain.

This repo will provide you with 99 project ideas you can implement using just ReactJS.

There's no better way of learning by actually doing.

Read the official React documentation for couple of days. Read few articles. Watch couple of videos. And, once you are able to grasp core concepts, start working on each of these projects to become master of ReactJS library.

Have you got some project ideas already? Feel free to fork this repo, contribute and make a Pull Request. Please maintain the consistency of repo structure if you decide to do so.
