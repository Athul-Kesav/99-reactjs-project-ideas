If you want you can accomplish this task with using just App component.

However, that's not the right approach. You should create different component for different UI.

For this app, you can have 

 - App component
 - Button component to render button
 - Image component to render images
 - Images component (if you decide to work on advance level) to render images
 - SelectSource component to let user select API source
