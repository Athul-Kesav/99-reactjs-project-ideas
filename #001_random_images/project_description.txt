Basic:

Create a simple web app showing random images at click of a button.

Make use of any open source image library API. For example, unsplash, lorempicsum etc.

Advanced:

Create one more component enabling users provide number of images they want at click of a button. 

This component can either be dropdown or text field depending on which is more comfortable for you.

Add one more component letting users select size (small, medium or large) and display image with that size.

How about making use of multiple APIs? Let users select from which source they want the images to be shown and render images from that API.

For example..
If user selects Flickr, make a call with Flickr API and get images from there. 
If user selects GettyImages, make a call with GettyImages API and so on.

Public APIs for Images:

- Flickr
- GettyImages
- Imgur
- Pixabay
- Unsplash

There are many. Explore them.
