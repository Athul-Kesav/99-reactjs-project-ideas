Goal: To make a simple Web App using React.JS or Next.JS that displays Random Quotes.

What you will learn in this Project: 
-> Structuring a Web App Layout.
-> Application of Basic CSS (Cascading Style Sheet).
-> How to make api calls through fetch API.
-> DOM (Document Object Model in Javascript)
-> Basics and Fundamentals of React.JS

API you can use: 
Type.fit API
(https://type.fit/api/quotes)

Core Features (Must have) :-

-> It should display a Random Quote with the name of Author below it.
-> It should have a Change Quote Button that enables user to change Quote when user clicks on it.
-> The Web App must be Responsive for all Devices.

Advanced Features (Extras you can do) :-
 
-> Add a Copy Button that copies the current quote and authors name to clipboard.
-> Add a Social Media Button where a user can share the current quote through Social Media apps like Twitter, Tumblr ,etc.
-> Add Animations while changing and loading quote.
-> You can also you use CSS Component Libraries or CSS Frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.


I am also attaching of an example in the example folder for reference but it will be better of learning rather than simply copying code from it.
