While using React :-
-> You can store images like: icons, badges in Public Folder.
-> You can make a components folder in Src Folder which has basic components like : Navbar, Quote, etc.
-> Navbar will be a simple navbar having an icon (if you want) and name of your project.
-> Quote component will have the main Quote and author's name.
-> Then you can proceed with making a button to change Quote.
